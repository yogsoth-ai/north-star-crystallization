# Validate Leaves

Ensure GoalTree leaf nodes are high quality.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via `subagent-spawning/spawn-agent` skill.

## Input

- GoalTree (full structure)
- Top goal statement

## Checks

- Is each leaf specific enough to act on?
- Is each leaf verifiable (can you tell when it's done)?
- Does the complete set of leaves cover the top goal?

## Output

Validation report — which leaves pass, which need further decomposition, coverage gaps.
