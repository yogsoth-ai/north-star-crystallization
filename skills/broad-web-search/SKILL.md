# Broad Web Search

Quick web scanning for landscape understanding.

## Execution

Import — strictly follow `web-browsing/web-search` skill protocol.

## Hard Constraints

- Set `count=10` on every `brave_web_search` call
- Execute multiple calls with varied queries
- Do not complete this SOP until at least 150 total search results have been gathered
- This ensures broad coverage, not just the first page of one query

## Import Source
