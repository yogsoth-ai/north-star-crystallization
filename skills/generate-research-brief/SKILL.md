# Generate Research Brief

Aggregate all context into a structured ResearchBrief.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via `subagent-spawning/spawn-agent` skill.

## Input

All accumulated artifacts from the crystallization process.

## Output

ResearchBrief — structured context document (not a research plan).

## Key Behavior

Does not output directly to user — feeds into final-validation first.
