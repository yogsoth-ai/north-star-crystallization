# Generate Candidate Fields

Generate candidate research fields for the user to explore.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via `subagent-spawning/spawn-agent` skill.

## Input

ActorProfile (full, as formatted text).

## Output

3-8 candidate fields, each with a one-line rationale for why this user could enter it.

## Key Behavior

When user wants to explore beyond their current stack, use boundary + intentionality to determine the exploration space. Don't limit to skills-only matching.
