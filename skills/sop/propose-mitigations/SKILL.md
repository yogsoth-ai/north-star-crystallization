# Propose Mitigations

Concrete, search-validated mitigation strategies for severe obstacles.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via `subagent-spawning/spawn-agent` skill.

## Input

- Obstacles with severity assessments
- ActorProfile

## Search

**Required** — must use imported skills to validate feasibility:
- web-search (web-browsing): Quick discovery of tools, frameworks, courses
- web-research (web-browsing): Deep reading of mitigation resources
- literature-overview (literature-engine): Find papers that solved similar obstacles
- literature-search (literature-engine): Medium-depth search for methodological alternatives
- literature-research (literature-engine): Deep reading for specific evidence

## Output

For each severe obstacle: mitigation strategy + evidence of feasibility + estimated effort.
