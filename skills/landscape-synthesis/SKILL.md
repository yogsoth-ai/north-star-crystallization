# Landscape Synthesis

Evaluate candidate fields and produce FieldPanorama.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via `subagent-spawning/spawn-agent` skill.

## Input

- Candidate fields list
- Accumulated web search results
- ActorProfile

## Output

FieldPanorama[] — structured evaluation of each field.

## Hard Constraint

Don't only propose niche/novel combinations or "stitched-together" approaches. Must also consider direct frontal competition in hot fields. The ambition to tackle hard problems head-on must be present.
